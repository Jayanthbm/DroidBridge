# P10 — Secure screen and screenshare-protection behaviour

**Status: in progress (2026-11-12).** Synthetic `FLAG_SECURE` protection in the mirrored stream has been exercised and observed to behave correctly (black/blank when secure, restored when cleared). A non-invasive banking-app observation (Slice) also showed protected output. Remaining P10 cases are not yet run.

> This report records evidence only. No attempt is made to bypass `FLAG_SECURE`, DRM, banking-app protections or protected surfaces (prohibited by AGENTS.md / security policy).

## Evidence

### 1) Synthetic `FLAG_SECURE` window (own experiment app) — observed correct

**Goal:** with mirroring active, toggling `WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SECURE` on the mirroring experiment window should cause the mirrored view to show black/blank/unavailable for that protected window, and clearing it should restore the live image. No protection bypass.

**Implementation (scoped to experiment):** `MirroringActivity` sets/clears `FLAG_SECURE` on its window via a UI toggle and logs `P10 FLAG_SECURE test: ON/OFF` (`899cc87`).

**Session/log evidence (S24, `adb -s 192.168.31.106:5555 logcat -d -s P08Mirroring`, 2026-11-12):**
- Fresh pairing after clearing stale Mac pin: forgot pin for `DroidBridge-P08-Mac` (09:51:32.721), discover/resolve `192.168.31.109:59490`, handshake `TLSv1.3` `authenticated=false` code `609218` (09:51:36.827), pairing confirmed and pin persisted (09:51:45.354), `peerPin=3b3d878a9b77bf4436d139b36a032a07ac3c5bdcd569fd77971e1384f7578fb7`.
- Mirroring started: consent requested/granted (09:51:53.003 / 09:51:56.156), service started (09:51:56.432), pipeline `590x1280` from content `1080x2340` encoder `c2.qti.avc.encoder`, `mirror.format` sent (09:51:56.517). Session remained active with `dropped=0`, `stopReason=active` (sampled frames 186→339, 09:52:01–09:52:26).
- **09:51:59.219** `P10 FLAG_SECURE test: ON (this window should appear black/blank in the mirror)`
- **09:52:01.307** `P10 FLAG_SECURE test: OFF`

**User-observed Mac result (2026-11-12):** when the toggle was turned **ON**, the Mac mirror showed a **black screen**; when turned **OFF**, the screen/image was visible again. This matches the expected protected-content behavior (FLAG_SECURE honoured in capture/mirror; no bypass).

**Result:** **Pass (synthetic FLAG_SECURE toggle, this run).** Protected window content was not shown in the mirror while secure; normal mirroring restored when cleared.

### 2) Banking app (Slice) — non-invasive observation, protected output observed

**Setup:** live mirroring active to Mac; user opened the Slice banking app on the S24 (non-invasive observation only — no interaction, no bypass attempt).

**User-observed Mac result (2026-11-12):** Mac mirror showed a **black screen** while Slice content was in the foreground.

**Result:** **Consistent with expected protected behavior** (protected/secure surface withheld from capture/mirror). Detailed session timing/log correlation for this specific observation was not captured in the log excerpt above; treat as a user-reported non-invasive observation pending a fully correlated evidence run if needed.

## Not yet tested (P10 remaining)

- Lock screen and notification shade while mirroring.
- Synthetic test app/activity focused on a **password field** (mirror should hide input).
- Synthetic **OTP-bearing notification** / related protected activity behavior.
- Notifications **with and without `setPublicVersion()`** — record what the mirror shows.
- Additional banking/DRM apps by **non-invasive observation only** (no interaction, no bypass).
- Confirmation that **no protected frames are cached** to disk or memory beyond the encode buffer.
- Fully correlated evidence runs (device/build/timestamps/logs/Mac state) for each case, with USB/USB-debugging/wireless-debugging state recorded per run.

## Limitations

- Mac-side visual outcome for the synthetic toggle is user-confirmed; not independently screenshot-captured by this tooling.
- ADB state recorded here reflects the host view at capture time (Wi-Fi ADB reachable); per-run USB/debugging state must still be recorded explicitly for each acceptance-relevant test.
- Banking-app observation is non-invasive and user-reported; no protected content was inspected, extracted, or bypassed.

## Current assessment

**In progress.** The synthetic `FLAG_SECURE` case and an initial banking-app observation indicate protected content is withheld from the mirrored output as required. P10 remains open until the remaining plan cases are exercised and recorded with evidence. P08 end-to-end acceptance (including its own protected-content/30-min/stability items) is also not fully closed.
